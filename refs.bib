  abstract  = "Phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a well-known
               but undervalued method of obtaining quantitative information on
               blood flow. Applications of this technique in cardiovascular MR
               imaging are expanding. According to the sequences available,
               phase-contrast measurement can be performed in a breath hold or
               during normal respiration. Prospective as well as retrospective
               gating techniques can be used. Common errors in phase-contrast
               imaging include mismatched encoding velocity, deviation of the
               imaging plane, inadequate temporal resolution, inadequate
               spatial resolution, accelerated flow and spatial
               misregistration, and phase offset errors. Flow measurements are
               most precise if the imaging plane is perpendicular to the vessel
               of interest and flow encoding is set to through-plane flow. The
               sequence should be repeated at least once, with a high encoding
               velocity used initially. If peak velocity has to be estimated,
               flow measurement is repeated with an adapted encoding velocity.
               The overall error of a phase-contrast flow measurement comprises
               errors during prescription as well as errors that occur during
               image analysis of the flow data. With phase-contrast imaging,
               the overall error in flow measurement can be reduced to less
               than 10\%, an acceptable level of error for routine clinical
               use.",
