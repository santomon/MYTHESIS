    abstract = "Phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a well-known
                but undervalued method of obtaining quantitative information on
                blood flow. Applications of this technique in cardiovascular MR
                imaging are expanding. According to the sequences available,
                phase-contrast measurement can be performed in a breath hold or
                during normal respiration. Prospective as well as retrospective
                gating techniques can be used. Common errors in phase-contrast
                imaging include mismatched encoding velocity, deviation of the
                imaging plane, inadequate temporal resolution, inadequate spatial
                resolution, accelerated flow and spatial misregistration, and
                phase offset errors. Flow measurements are most precise if the
                imaging plane is perpendicular to the vessel of interest and flow
                encoding is set to through-plane flow. The sequence should be
                repeated at least once, with a high encoding velocity used
                initially. If peak velocity has to be estimated, flow measurement
                is repeated with an adapted encoding velocity. The overall error
                of a phase-contrast flow measurement comprises errors during
                prescription as well as errors that occur during image analysis
                of the flow data. With phase-contrast imaging, the overall error
                in flow measurement can be reduced to less than 10\%, an
                acceptable level of error for routine clinical use.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Surface coil-related field inhomogeneity potentially
               confounds pixel-wise quantitative analysis of perfusion CMR
               images. This study assessed the effect of surface coil-related
               field inhomogeneity on the spatial variation of pixel-wise
               myocardial blood flow (MBF), and assessed its impact on the
               ability of MBF quantification to differentiate ischaemic from
               remote coronary territories. Two surface coil intensity
               correction (SCIC) techniques were evaluated: 1) a proton
               density-based technique (PD-SCIC) and; 2) a saturation recovery
               steady-state free precession-based technique (SSFP-SCIC).
               METHODS: 26 subjects (18 with significant CAD and 8 healthy
               volunteers) underwent stress perfusion CMR using a
               motion-corrected, saturation recovery SSFP dual-sequence
               protocol. A proton density (PD)-weighted image was acquired at
               the beginning of the sequence. Surface coil-related field
               inhomogeneity was approximated using a third-order surface fit
               to the PD image or a pre-contrast saturation prepared SSFP
               image. The estimated intensity bias field was subsequently
               applied to the image series. Pixel-wise MBF was measured from
               mid-ventricular stress images using the two SCIC approaches and
               compared to measurements made without SCIC. RESULTS: MBF
               heterogeneity in healthy volunteers was higher using SSFP-SCIC
               (24.8 $\pm$ 4.1\%) compared to PD-SCIC (20.8 $\pm$ 3.0\%; p =
               0.009), however heterogeneity was significantly lower using
               either SCIC technique compared to analysis performed without
               SCIC (36.2 $\pm$ 6.3\%). In CAD patients, the difference in MBF
               between remote and ischaemic territories was minimal when
               analysis was performed without SCIC (0.06 $\pm$ 0.91 mL/min/kg),
               and was substantially lower than with either PD-SCIC (0.50 $\pm$
               0.63 mL/min/kg; p = 0.013) or with SSFP-SCIC (0.63 $\pm$ 0.89
               mL/min/kg; p = 0.005). In 6 patients, MBF quantified without
               SCIC was artifactually higher in the stenosed coronary territory
               compared to the remote territory. PD-SCIC and SSFP-SCIC had
               similar differences in MBF between remote and ischaemic
               territories (p = 0.145). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates
               that surface coil-related field inhomogeneity can confound
               pixel-wise MBF quantification. Whilst a PD-based SCIC led to a
               more homogenous correction than a saturation recovery SSFP-based
               technique, this did not result in an appreciable difference in
               the differentiation of ischaemic from remote coronary
               territories and thus either method could be applied.",
